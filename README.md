# Prize Money in Darts

## Summary

I used Excel and Power BI to analyse data related to the top 32 darts players in the world in 2021. I identified trends such as the spread of prize money among the players, the ages of the players and their nationalities. More details on the project and my findings are available below.

## Background

In darts, the top 32 players in the world are often referred to as 'the world's elite' since they automatically qualify for the world darts championship based on their ranking. Hence, this presents a natural cut-off point for analysing data about the world's top players. In this project, I analysed the career earnings of players in the top 32 and identified that there was a 'super-elite': the top 16 players earn significantly more than the rest of the top 32. In the results section, I discuss this and other trends that emerged from the data.

## Part 1 - Cleaning the Data

I used Excel to perform data cleaning tasks like removing duplicates and other inconsistencies in the data. I also removed unnecessary columns like the player nicknames which are not useful for quantitative analysis. Next, I removed all entries from players who were not in the top 32 in the world as I knew that I wanted to focus solely on elite players.

## Part 2 - Exploratory Data Analysis

It quickly became clear that the top half of the top 32, that is the top 16 players, earned significantly more than those ranked 17 - 32. In fact, they earned 80.95% of the total prize money earned by the top 32. Furthermore, the top 6 career earners (all in the world's top 16) earned more than all the other players combined (53.42% of the total earnings).The players' nationalities are also worth noting. All but one of the players are from Europe with half of them coming from England. 23 of the 32 players (72%) are from the UK. The average age of the top 16 was the same as that of the top 32, but there were no players under 30 in the top 16, indicating that it takes a significant amount of time to reach the top level in darts.

## Part 3 - Creating the Dashboard

To summarise and visualise these results, I created a dashboard in Power BI with four visuals. The pie chart compares the earnings between the top 16 and top 32 players. It also allows users to drill down and see earnings by country as well as the share of prize money won by individual players. The treemap shows the striking bias towards English players in the world's elite. The column graph clearly visualises the major disparity in earnings between the top ranked players and the rest. Finally, the histogram demonstrates that age is not a major factor in darts since prize money is relatively well spread among different age groups.

## Key Results and Conclusions

The concentration of prize money in the top 16 is indicative of the longstanding problem of elitism in darts. This is a well known issue in which the PDC (the sport's main event organiser) allows top ranked players to automatically qualify for prestigious events like the world matchplay and the world masters. Many of these top players are also selected for the premier league: a lucrative event in which they can earn significant sums of money. As a result of this system, the players in the top 16 on this list have earned, on average, more than 4 times as much as as players ranked 17 - 32.

Grouping players by nationality provides valuable insight into the growth of the sport. The fact that nearly all of the players (31 out of 32) are from Europe shows that the sport still has significant work to do in terms of growing globally. In addition to this, 72% of the players originating from the UK is a sign of the bias shown by the PDC to UK players and tournaments. The vast majority of major tournaments and events are held in the UK (often in England) and it may be necessary to change this in future to grow the sport. The European Tour events have helped in this regard (hence the presence of European players in the top rankings), but other parts of the world are still available for growth.

Lastly, it is interesting to note that, unlike other sports, growing older does not seem to be a significant disadvantage in darts. The average age of the players on this list was 39 which is higher than might be expected from other sports which are more athletically demanding. There are only four players on the list who are under 30 (and none in the top 16) which indicates that experience matters greatly when it comes to playing darts at the top level.

## Future Possibilities

It would be interesting to compare the earnings of the top 32 players to the rest of the players on the PDC rankings to see the differences in prize money. Another potential analysis would be looking at the historical spread of prize money among the top players to see how long this trend has continued and whether it is improving or becoming worse.
